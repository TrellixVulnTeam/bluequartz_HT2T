- File permissions for a user with a period in their name do not get set
correctly. 
- If a file is larger than 900 megabytes, CMU will go into a endless
loop until it runs out of memory.
- File permissions on the user mail spool are not set correctly. 
- Group file permission can get set to the wrong site number (siteX).
- Vacation auto reply settings fail to migrate.
- Users importing on a RaQ3, the string "off" appears in the  Forwarding
mail field.  The RaQ then forwards all mail messages sent to the  user
to the nonexistent email address ("off").
- Incorrect permissions on /etc/shadow after import

2.51 (04-09-2003)
Changes:
- Added -D option to cmuExport and cmuImport to export and import DNS server settings (RaQ550 to RaQ550 DNS migration no done yet)
- If the md5sums do not match skip the tar archive (duh!)
- Fixes for RaQ550 to RaQ550 conflict resolution
- RaQ550adjust.pl now lower cases all email aliases for users 
- Fixes for RaQ550scanin.pl 
- Auto dns will now reflect the correct setting instead of being always on, Auto dns will be turned off if -D is provided

Things to watch out for in RaQ550 to RaQ550 migrations, basically these are things that cause problems in migration. I haven't had a chance to test these it bascially a TODO list:
- User mail spools
- Apop password configuration for users
- Frontpage server extensions for users and sites
- SSL certs not being restored for sites
- Migrated logs directory might break site stats
- Not all mail list functions are restore properly
- User defaults may not be migrated

2.52 (05-05-2003)
- fixed a bug in dnsImport where very-high priority need to get
changed to very_high for cce
- added writing of configuration for thrid party scripts they now get two arguments first is the destination dir second is the configuration in xml format in a file

2.53 (05-09-2003)
- remove the altname tag for Japanese migrations in RaQ550adjust.pl
- fix for the way CMU adds double-byte chars to CCE
