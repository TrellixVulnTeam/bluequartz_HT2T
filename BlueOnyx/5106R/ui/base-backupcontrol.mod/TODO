We should remove the serverLock item from CCE and use a 
extra-CCE flag of some sort to reload cced into a read-only
state with friendly error messages.

"lock"ing CCE will cause it to enter a read-only mode, with 
friendly error message(s).  UIFC should pick up on this and
force UI field ro in this mode, or minimally include a warning
message and deactivate submit buttons.

To lock a future release of CCE, run the command "SUSPEND".

To resume CCE read/write mode, run "RESUME".

UIFC should also report that the system is locked before
changes are attempted.
