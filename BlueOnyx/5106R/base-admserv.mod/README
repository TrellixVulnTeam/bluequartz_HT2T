PLEASE NOTE:

As of right now this module is no longer compatible with anything *but* CentOS5. 

httpd.conf, php.ini and php.conf have been modified for usage on CentOS5 only.

httpd.conf was changed because some modules on the newer Apache have been renamed.

php.conf was of course modified because we now use PHP5 instead of PHP4.

php.ini was changed to switch the extension_dir path from ...

extension_dir = /usr/lib/php4

... to ..

extension_dir = /usr/lib/php/modules

The Makefile and SPEC file need to be fixed if we want to retain downward compatability.
