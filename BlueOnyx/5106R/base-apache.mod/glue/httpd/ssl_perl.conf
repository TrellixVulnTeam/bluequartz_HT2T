            # Explanation: The fuckers at RedHat had crippled OpenSSL so that elliptic curve ciphers were missing.
            # They added some of them back recently. See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=319901
            # As far as Apache is concerned, the ECDHE ciphers *still* do not work. For that we would need Apache 2.4.
            #
            # What's worse: On CentOS5 we only have OpenSSL-0.9.8, so TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 are *not* available.
            # 
            # For securing HTTPS we want to achieve the following:
            # - Do not use weak or comprimised ciphers: OK (as best as possible)
            # - Use Strict Transport Security (HSTS): OK
            # - Support Forward Secrecy (PFS) for as many browsers as possible: OK, but fail for Internet Explorer.
            #
            # With ECDHE not available (which we'd need to get PFS working with IE browsers), we fall back to DHE,
            # which allows Forward Secrecy on all browsers. Execept the ones from Microsoft. It's the next best 
            # thing below ECDHE. 
            #
            # Most Microsoft browsers post Windows XP's IE will use either TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA instead.
            # Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari will almost all use TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA instead, which 
            # allows Forward Secrecy. Anything but IE6/XP, IE8/XP, Java 6u45 and Java 7u25 (which will use 168bit keys)
            # will use 256bit keys instead. 
            #
            # Protocols: Only IE6/XP will use SSLv3. All the rest default to TLS1.0 or TLSv1.2.
            #
            # Ciphers: RC4 and other weak ciphers have been disabled.
            #
            # Further reading: https://bettercrypto.org/static/applied-crypto-hardening.pdf
            # But note: Their suggested cipher-string and ours are different. Despite that we
            # achieve the same results for all browsers and also retain compatibility with IE6/XP
            # and IE8/XP for those poor buggers that still use that crap.
