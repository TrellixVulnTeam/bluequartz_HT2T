For version 2.1:
=================

2.1-0BX01
- With the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
  and the EU-DSGVO creeping up on us it's time to provide the means
  for our EU users to conform with the regulations. Even if the
  regulations are as stupid as they are.
- Added new GUI page /sitestats/logconfig that allows to configure  
  maximum renention time for logs. If Vsites have a longer retention
  time for their statistics, then their retention time is reset to
  the new maximum.

Stuff that still needs to be done:

- Once 'System' . 'Sitestats' . 'purge' has been updated, we need to
  update the logrotate configs of all bloody services as well.

- Update locales!
