This document explains the config subsystem of the CCE:

Config files are named *.conf, placed in /usr/sausalito/conf

Config files are made up of the following format:
 * blank lines are ignored
 * lines starting with # are comments, and ignored
 * all other lines have three fields:
 	EVENT		HANDLER		STAGE?
 * EVENT field is of the format: CLASS "." (NAMESPACE ".")? PROPERTY
 	e.g.: Class.property  or  Class.npsace.property
   Property may be a valid class property or a '*' meaning all properties
   If no NAMESPACE is specified, _CREATE and _DESTROY are also valid properties
 * HANDLER field is of the format: TYPE ":" DATA
 	e.g.: exec:/bin/blah
 * STAGE field is optiona and is case insensitive.  It maybe  one of: 
 	VALIDATE
	CONFIGURE
	EXECUTE
	TEST
	CLEANUP
   STAGE is assumed to be EXECUTE if no stage is specified
 * All fields are whitespace delimited, but must be on one line.
