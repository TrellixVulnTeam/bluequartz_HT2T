Building requires the following RPMs to be installed:

BuildRequires: glib-devel, pam-devel
BuildRequires: glib-ghash
BuildRequires: flex, bison
BuildRequires: php-devel
BuildRequires: php
BuildRequires: db4-devel (for pam_abl)

Actually, it helps to have the whole shebang installed:

php-soap php-common php-pear-Mail php-process php-pear php-pear-Net-Socket php-pear-Auth-SASL php php-gd php-mysql php-pdo php-mcrypt php-devel php-xml php-imap php-mbstring php-pear-Net-SMTP php-cli

glib and glib-devel are usually on Epel.

glib-ghash is available as SRPM via devel.blueonyx.it/pub ... check the SRPMS directories.
