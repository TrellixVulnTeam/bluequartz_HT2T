OCSP stapling, formally known as the TLS Certificate Status Request extension, allows the presenter of a certificate to bear the resource cost involved in providing OCSP responses by appending ('stapling') a time-stamped OCSP response signed by the CA to the initial TLS handshake, eliminating the need for clients to contact the CA."
