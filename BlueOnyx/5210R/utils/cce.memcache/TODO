TODO:
----
version codb for smooth upgrades
use version on classes to do some type of upgrade (!)
MUST: make changes to all released versions to make them more relaxed about
	schema validity checking for 3rd party app compat.
provide a cce-config, like glib-config
better -nf handling
what if we GET an object of invalid class
what if we GET and illegal properties exist
what if we put magic props in a schema
	-- any property starting with _ is reserved and not schema-able
protect ODB files (umask!)
Logging/debugging cleanup
	Don't log Passwords/Authkeys (generic answer)
codb cleanup - e.g.: 15 calls to impl_obj_exists() on a GET
configuration file
	session_timeout
be more stringent (and correct) about doing session cleanup 
	(instead of blocking accept(), use select(), run cleanups at timeout)
Better reporting from codb to cscp.  Eg. Perm denied on props during create


WISHLIST:
---------
per-class default acls
put leading underscores on magic properties
new basetype: enum
CSCP: handle all properties as "(namespace.)?propname"
CSCP extension to get a single property of an oid
CSCP extension to do generic 'find Object'
CSCP: STRUCTURE(GETSCHEMA?) command
CSCP: CLASSVER <class> command
SCHEMA property: NOSAVE properties of classes
replace syslog() with sauslog()
	start cced and fork a log handler thread
	opensauslog(logname, idstr, log_stderr);
		open(LOGDIR "/" logname ".log");
	closesauslog();
	sauslog(syslog_style_params);
stacked codb
	object cache layer:
		accessed objects are put into an opaque structure
			stored in codb
		pointer to structure is used everywhere
			changes to objs stored in each codb_handle
		when refcount drops, codb frees object 
			(no more getting hashes multiple times)
inheritance
arbitrarily deep sub-namespaces
typedefs that can reference other typedefs in 'data'
classconf stored IN codb
no i18n in CCE or all i18n in CCE
new CSCP warnings: 
	3xx UNKNOWN PROPERTY (set/create only)
	3xx INVALID DATATYPE (set/create) - maybe just log this?
	cover each error case with a specific message or unify as much as
		possible to minimal set of msgs
make $ style variables in CCE conf files ($SAUSALITO, for example)
make an allowable type (for property) be anon:(type definition)
	anon:re:^foo$
	anon:exec:/tmp/bar
provide true local datatypes


ODB TODO:
--------
get rid of _LISTS propfile
schema importer tool
rename _SCALARS -> _PROPS
