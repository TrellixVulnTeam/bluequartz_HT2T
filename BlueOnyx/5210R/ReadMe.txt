BlueOnyx 5210R:
===============

This is the development tree for BlueOnyx 5210R for CentOS 8.

As CentOS 8 isn't out yet, we're using the RHEL8 Beta as a base in order to port
our code from 5209R to 5210R.

There is a lot of work to be done and until that is finished the code in this
part of SVN will be a disaster zone. Or like they say: "There will be dragons!"

Base of 5210R is the 5209R SVN code tree as of 2018-11-16.
That's SVN Revision 3205 or thereabouts.
