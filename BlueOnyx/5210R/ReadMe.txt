5210R:
======

Please note: 5210R is just the working title of BlueOnyx 5209R with IPv6 support
while said IPv6 support is in development. As that development might take some 
time it's safer to temporarily fork the 5209R code tree into an unstable devel
tree. As that tree needs a name, it temporarily gets the 5210R moniker.

BlueOnyx on CentOS 7 with IPv6 support  will not be released as 5210R but as 
regular 5209R YUM update. Said update will retain the the 5209R moniker after 
said release is completed, tested and deemed production ready.
