For version 2.1:
=================

* Sat Apr 28 2018 Michael Stauber <mstauber@solarspeed.net> 2.1-0BX01
- With the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
  and the EU-DSGVO creeping up on us it's time to provide the means
  for our EU users to conform with the regulations. Even if the
  regulations are as stupid as they are.
- Added new GUI page /sitestats/logconfig that allows to configure   
  maximum renention time for logs. If Vsites have a longer retention
  time for their statistics, then their retention time is reset to
  the new maximum. Additionally this page can reset AWStats and
  Webalizer stats as well as enable auto-pruning of the AV-SPAM
  'milter_usage' table if the AV-SPAM is installed.
- Added constructor/purge_avspam.pl
- Modified glue/conf/sitestats.conf
- Added glue/handlers/purge_avspam.pl
- Added glue/handlers/purge_awstats.pl
- Added glue/handlers/purge_webalizer.pl
- Modified glue/handlers/purge_update.pl
- Modified glue/schemas/sitestats.schema
- Extended sitetstats-scripts
