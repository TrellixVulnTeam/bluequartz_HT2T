  DEVELOPER INFO FOR ISTAT
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Prerequisites
  
  You will need GNU autoconf installed. Most Linux distributions include
  this in a package named "autoconf" or "autoconf-26" or similar. You will
  need at least version 2.61 of autoconf.
  
  You will also need libxml2. If your operating system has separate 'user'
  and 'developer' packages, you will need to install the 'developer' package.
  For example, on Ubuntu, you need to install 'libxml2-dev'. This package
  contains the header files and libraries used at compile-time.
  
  At present, iStat Server only builds and runs on Linux. Ports to other
  operating systems are planned!
  
  2. Preparing the source tree (Subversion check-outs only)
  
  If you've checked out the sources from the Subversion repository or have
  downloaded a snapshot, your source directory won't contain a 'configure'
  script and you will need to run 'autogen' to generate one. The autogen
  script invokes autoconf and automake, so you'll need those installed
  (autoconf should be verson 2.61 or above, and automake should be at
  least version 1.10).
 
  You might find that even though you have autoconf and automake installed,
  the programs that are installed aren't actually called 'autoconf' or
  'automake' (or the ones with those names are old versions). If this is
  the case, you should set the ACLOCAL110, AUTOHEADER26, AUTOCONF26 and
  AUTOMAKE110 environment variables to the names of the relevant programs
  on your system before running autogen.
  
  Check out the source tree if you haven't already:
  
  $ svn co http://istat.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ istat
  
  Change to the source directory, if you're not in it already:
  
  $ cd istat
  
  Generate config.h.in and configure from the configure.in template:
  
  $ sh autogen
  
  If you (or somebody else) makes changes to configure.in or any of the
  Makefile.am files, you will need to re-run the above command (making
  sure the above environment variables are still set if you needed them).
  
  3. Run the configure script
  
  For a default configuration, simply run the configure script in the
  source directory. This will perform tests on your build environment and
  generate a Makefile:
  
  $ ./configure
  
  By default, the configure script will generate a Makefile which installs
  files to /usr/local. You can change this with the --prefix option:
  
  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/istat
  
  If you wish to have the configuration file, istat.conf, stored in /etc,
  then you can specify this location in the configure command:
  
  $ ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
  
  The defaults should be fine for most users, and shouldn't conflict with
  packages supplied by your operating system vendor.
  
  4. Build it!
  
  $ make
 
  If successful, you should be left with an 'istatd' binary.
  
  5. Install it
  
  Generally, you will need to be an administrator user in order to install it.
  This varies between distributions, but typically you can install with:
  
  $ sudo make install
  
  If you want to prefix installation paths in order to install a staging 
  directory (for example, for packaging), set the DESTDIR variable:
  
  $ sudo make install DESTDIR=/tmp/istat-packaging
  
  6. Create a tarball
  
  To create a tarball, simply run 'make dist' after you've successfully
  configured your tree. This will create a .tar.gz file containing the
  sources ready for distribution. Note that the version number used in
  the filename will probably be the one after the last released version,
  as it gets set in preparation for the next future.
