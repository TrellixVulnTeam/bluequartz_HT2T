[ DESCRIPTION ]

  This is a set of scripts for querying and displaying bugzilla bug
  lists and details.  buglist and buglist.conf are from an ancient
  bugzilla page somewhere.  It is an ugly script that doesn't have
  the best interface, but I wasn't in the mood to recreate it from
  scratch.  So the bugs.pl script is my wrapper to provide a cleaner
  interface and query storage.


[ REQUIREMENTS ]

  wget, urlview


[ INSTALL ]

  Put bugs.pl & buglist in a bin directory and buglist.conf either in
  that same dir or in /etc.  Then you can edit the specific queries in
  the top part of bugs.pl:

  mine => {
      -host   => q[bugzilla.sfbay.sun.com],
      -cgidir => q[bugs],
      status  => [qw[NEW ASSIGNED REOPENED]],
      owner   => [qq[duncan.laurie\@sun.com]]
  }
  mothra => {
      -host   => q[mothra.sfbay.sun.com],
      -cgidir => q[bugzilla-2.10],
      status  => [qw[NEW ASSIGNED REOPENED]],
      owner   => [qq[duncan.laurie\@sun.com]]
  }

  There is a list of valid options at the top of the bugs.pl script.


[ USAGE ]

  You can call defined queries like this:

    bugs.pl -q mine

  There are also other operations that can be done on a specific bug, eg:

    bugs.pl -g 15000            // display bug 15000 to stdout
    bugs.pl -q mothra -g 300    // display mothra bug 300 to stdout
    bugs.pl -o 15000            // open bug 15000 in browser (with urlview)
