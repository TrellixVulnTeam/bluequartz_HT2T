BlueQuartz 5106:
=================

This build of BlueQuartz is for CentOS5.2 only. 

As of right now this build is considered Beta quality and should be treated as such. 

Do not build and/or install it on CentOS4!
------------------------------------------

==============================================================================
!!!!!!!!! DO NOT USE THE RPMs BUILT FROM THIS SOURCES ON CENTOS4 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
==============================================================================

I cannot stress that enough for now: 

If you run a BlueQuartz on CentOS4 (5102), then do _NOT_ attempt to manually upgrade
it with the RPMs generated from this sources. WAIT for us to get the bugs out of this
code first and also wait until we provide an update mechanism that will work.

For now:

DO NOT (!) use this code to run productive websites or anything important. 
Use it for testing purpose only and PLEASE report any bugs you find to the [cobra-e] 
mailing list.

Yes, there should still be some bugs left.


NOT YET DONE:
=============

- Frontpage support:

Frontpage support is NOT yet included. As of now I can't get FP compile against
Apache-2.2.3, but I'll see what can be done about it later on.

- nuonce-authExternal:

Needs to be rebuild for Apache-2-2 with the latest sources from:
http://www.unixpapa.com/mod_auth_external/
and possibly http://www.unixpapa.com/pwauth/

New SRPMs outside the SVN tree:
===============================

analog-5.32-2BQ3.src.rpm
bluequartz-yumconf-5-0BQ1.src.rpm
cgiwrap-3.9-1BQ6.src.rpm
mod_cband-0.9.7.2-4.centos5.src.rpm
ms-sys-2.1.2-1.rf.src.rpm
nuonce-mindterm-2.5-2.src.rpm
poprelayd-2.1-0BQ5.src.rpm
proftpd-1.3.1-1BQ1.src.rpm
re2c-0.13.2-1.rf.src.rpm
perl-Authen-PAM-0.15-BQ1.src.rpm

- analog needed to be rebuild for CentOS5, but I still use the old BlueQuartz SRPM.

- bluequartz-yumconf was updated for CentOS5, but for now I disabled the
bluequartz.org mirrors and instead added a Solarspeed.net mirror out of
which I host the RPMs during the beta phase. This needs to be changed
at one time or another before the end of the beta phase.

FWIW: The mirror is available here:

[BQ-5106-Solarspeed]
name=BlueQuartz 5106R on CentOS5 - $basearch
baseurl=http://bq5106.solarspeed.net/pub/BlueQuartz/5106R/CentOS5/bluequartz/$basearch/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1

- cgiwrap needed to be rebuild against CentOS5

- mod_cband uses the same SPEC file as before, but the latest sources. 

- ms-sys could use an update, so it was rebuild on CentOS5 from a newer SRPM.

- nuonce-mindterm needed a rebuild as two PHP pages were not showing the last 
fields. Had to apply the work around to them and rebuild the RPM.

- poprelayd is not available for CentOS5, so I rebuild the BlueQuartz SRPM.

- proftpd was rebuild from the latest sources, the SPEC-file from Dag Wiers, 
but needed a modified PAM config file, the old BlueQuartz logrotate file 
and a quite modified proftpd.conf, as quite a bit changed between 1.2.X 
and 1.3.X.

- re2c was rebuild from an unmodified SRPM taken from Dag Wiers repository.
I18n required a more modern re2c present during compilation that the one
we used before.

- perl-Authen-PAM is a dependency of nuonce-authExternal, which I have not yet
fixed for Apache-2.2.X

I'll upload these SRPMs to bluequartz.org later on.


Modules NOT (yet) ported to 5106:
=================================

base-frontpage.mod:
-------------------
Frontpage doesn't compile against Apache-2.2.X, as the authentication
mechanisms have changed between Apache-2.0.X and 2.2.X. I don't yet
know if this can be fixed, but at this time I don't want to spend 
that much time on it. Hence I'll leave that for later.

base-bandwidth.mod:
-------------------
Was obsoleted by base-apache-bandwidth.mod anyway, which serves
the same purpose. So this dead weight was removed from the codebase.

base-firewall.mod:
------------------
The quality of this module leaves a lot to be desired. For this 
reason it also is not included in the NuOnce CD builds, nor the
Aventurin{e} OS templates. So I really see no reason to port it.

base-storage.mod:
-----------------
Module for making external or additional disk storage available. 
Not included on the NuOnce CD and it's buggy as hell anyway. No need 
to port it until it is fixed anyway.


Just for reference:
===================

To build 5106 from the sources on a CentOS5.1 you need to satisfy quite a few
dependencies, which are not always very transparent. I lost my notes of what I
had to install along the way, so for future reference here is a list of all 
installed RPMs on my current CentOS5.1 development box (minus the obvious
BlueQuartz RPMs built from the SVN).

This list includes a LOT more than the bare minimum just needed for the build, 
so you can of course make do with quite a bit less. Especially when fighting
with getting Sausalito to compile I resorted to installing a lot of unneeded
stuff - just to cover the odd chance that one of the RPMs was indeed needed. :p

On a sidenote:
==============

When I picked up on this conversion project (5102 -> 5106) Brian Smith had already done 
a lot of solid groundwork in the conversion of Sausalito and I18n from PHP4 to PHP5.
Brian got it to compile and that was quite a tremendous feat, as the errors he has run
into along the way were quite a tough nut to crack. His notes made it reproduceable
to compile the code and that's where I eventually picked up and polished it further.

I am 100% certain that when we finally release this code as updates (or new ISO) and
consider it ready for productive usage, then there will still be a lot of screaming
on the mailing lists, because some odd things here and there may still not work entirely
right. That can only be avoided with a LOT of testing, carried out by willing helpers from
the userbase.

Which we will probably not get - aside from a handful of the usual helpful souls.

Now some people will ask: Why did it take so long? Why the heck didn't we have this
ready sooner?

Answer:

						       -------------

If this had been a billable coding job, the invoice so far would be in the lower five 
figure range (EUR, not YEN or USD). So yes, it took time, will still need MORE time 
to polish the code further. Unfortunately the number of people that'll really appreciate
the voluntarily carried out work will probably be quite low ...
