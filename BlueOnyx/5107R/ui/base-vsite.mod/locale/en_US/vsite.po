msgstr "UID/GID checks are bypassed when including files from this directory and its subdirectories. This directive can take a colon (semi-colon on Windows) separated path, rather than just a single directory. The restriction specified is actually a prefix, not a directory name. This means that 'safe_mode_include_dir = /dir/incl' also allows access to '/dir/include' and '/dir/incls' if they exist. When you want to restrict access to only the specified directory, end with a slash. For example: 'safe_mode_include_dir = /dir/incl/'. If the value of this directive is empty, no files with different UID/GID can be included."

msgid "open_basedir_help"
msgstr "Limit the files that can be opened by PHP to the specified directory-tree, including the file itself. This directive is NOT affected by whether Safe Mode is turned On or Off. When a script tries to open a file with, for example, fopen() or gzopen(), the location of the file is checked. When the file is outside the specified directory-tree, PHP will refuse to open it. All symbolic links are resolved, so it's not possible to avoid this restriction with a symlink. The special value '.' indicates that the working directory of the script will be used as the base-directory. This is, however, a little dangerous as the working directory of the script can easily be changed with chdir(). By default virtual sites only have access to /home, /tmp, /var/lib/php/session/ and the root directory of the virtual site in question."

msgid "allow_url_fopen"

msgid "allow_url_fopen_help"
msgstr "If enabled, allow_url_fopen allows PHP's file functions - such as file_get_contents() and the include and require statements - can retrieve data from remote locations, like an FTP or web site. Programmers frequently forget this and don't do proper input filtering when passing user-provided data to these functions, opening them up to code injection vulnerabilities. A large number of code injection vulnerabilities and hacks reported in PHP-based web applications are caused by the combination of enabling allow_url_fopen and bad input filtering. Off by default."

msgid "allow_url_include"
msgstr "Allow URL include:"

msgid "allow_url_include_help"

Please note: include and require are the most common attack points for code injection attempts, so this setting plugs that particular hole without affecting the remote file access capabilities of the standard file functions. By default, allow_url_include is disabled."

msgid "upload_max_filesize"
msgstr "Upload max filesize:"

msgid "upload_max_filesize_help"
msgstr "upload_max_filesize limits the maximum size of files that PHP will accept through uploads.
