	# Explanation: The fuckers at RedHat had crippled OpenSSL so that elliptic curve ciphers were missing.
        # They added some of them back recently. See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=319901
        # As far as Apache is concerned, the ECDHE ciphers *still* do not work. For that we would need Apache 2.4.
        # On the bright side, TLSv1.2 is finally working with this version of OpenSSL.
        # 
        # For securing HTTPS we want to achieve the following:
        # - Do not use weak or comprimised ciphers: OK (as best as possible)
        # - Use Strict Transport Security (HSTS): OK
        # - Support Forward Secrecy (PFS) for as many browsers as possible: OK, but fail for Internet Explorer.
        #
        # With ECDHE not available (which we'd need to get PFS working with IE browsers), we fall back to DHE,
        # which allows Forward Secrecy on all browsers. Execept the ones from Microsoft. It's the next best 
        # thing below ECDHE. 
        #
        # Most Microsoft browsers post Windows XP's IE will use either TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA instead.
	# Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari will almost all use TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA instead, which 
        # allows Forward Secrecy. Anything but IE6/XP, IE8/XP, Java 6u45 and Java 7u25 (which will use 168bit keys)
        # will use 256bit keys instead. 
        #
	# Protocols: Only IE6/XP will use SSLv3. All the rest default to TLS1.0 or TLSv1.2.
        #
	# Ciphers: RC4 and other weak ciphers have been disabled.
        #
        # Further reading: https://bettercrypto.org/static/applied-crypto-hardening.pdf
        # But note: Their suggested cipher-string and ours are different. Despite that we
        # achieve the same results for all browsers and also retain compatibility with IE6/XP
        # and IE8/XP for those poor buggers that still use that crap.
