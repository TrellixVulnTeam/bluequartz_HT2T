msgid "enableSSH"
msgstr "Enable SSH Server"

msgid "enableSSH_help"
msgstr "Enabling ssh allows users with shell access to connect to this server using ssh client software.  Use of ssh is generally considered more secure than use of telnet since ssh encrypts all data including passwords that are sent between the client and the server."

msgid "SSH_Port"
msgstr "SSH Port:"

msgid "SSH_Port_help"
msgstr "By default SSH runs on port 22/TCP. However, you can configure it to run on another port instead in order to attempt to evade automated brute force login attacks."

msgid "SSH_Proto"
msgstr "SSH Protocol:"

msgid "SSH_Proto_help"
msgstr "SSH supports two protocols: Protocol version 1 and version 2. Two is more advanced and secure. If possible, you should use only protocol 2. But you can also set it to '2,1', in which case applications that support protocol 2 will use it, while older applications that only support protocol 1 can fall back to that instead."

msgid "SSHrootLogin"
msgstr "SSH Root Login:"

msgid "SSHrootLogin_help"
msgstr "By default and for security reasons direct SSH login as user 'root' is typically not allowed. If needed, you can allow it here."
