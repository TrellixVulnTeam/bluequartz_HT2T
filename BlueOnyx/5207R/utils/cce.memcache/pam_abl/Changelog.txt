pam-abl is a pam module designed to automatically block hosts which are attempting a brute force attack.

Building
Pam-abl doesn't come with a normal makefile, mostly because I find them to complicated for what they need to do. That's why I decided to go with cmake.
If you are handy with the autotools framework, feel free to write some scripts and I will be happy to include them.



Changelog:
0.6.0
Bugfix release for the 0.5.0 release. But because there are some 
incompatibilities between this version and 0.5.0 we increased the 
version number.
Incompatibilities:
- target is named pam_abl again
- syntax for specifying the commands to run has changed (please see the manpages for more details)
Fixes:
- BUG #33 test.c fails to compile on hurd-i386 (thanx to  Alex Mestiashvili for reporting this bug)
- create a copy of the user/host/service (reported by Dan)
- Rename targets to pam_abl (sorry for the name mixup in previous release)
- automatically cleanup db log files
- security fix, do not run commands using system(). Please see the manpages for more details.
- Sourceforge bug #3564436 second authentication succeeds

0.5.0
This version is a total rewrite of the previous versions. I guess +-400 lines are unchanged (mostly dealing with parsing the config file).
The total rewrite results in a lot more stability and some extra features (Please see the manpages in the doc directory for more details).
- the two db tables have been merged making db locking easier
- added a block reason, making troubleshooting easier
- introduce limits in the db, preventing a hacker from filling up the machine
- white listing support for users, computers and ip ranges
- fixed the custom commands, they were a little bit buggy in previous versions
- and a lot more

0.4.3.1
Fix a segfault when no user_rule is provided (Sourceforge bug #3556423)

0.4.3
Fix printf problem on 32bit machines, as reported by Petr Písař and antpu on
Sourceforge bug #3472603.

Fixed cursor close bug. (Sourceforge #3468220)
	
Fixed pointer alias problem. (Sourceforge bug #3469379)

Incorporate the very helpful patches from Lode (a.k.a. danta on sourceforge)
which add transactions to the databases to prevent corruption with
concurrent access, change the script calling behavior and clean up some
resources. (Sourceforge bug #3469409)

0.4.2
Streamlined database handling to reduce the number of times the databases need
to be opened.
Fixed a bug with host blocking.
Added a patch from sourceforge to fix long options for the command line tool.
Fixed some reported typos.
Fixed automake to actually use the -Wall and -Werror options.  They were in the wrong macro before.
Fixed compiler warnings.

0.4.1
Fixed a bad typo that caused the PAM portion to always fail people.
Clarified some documentation, updated examples and fixed some typos.

0.4.0
***THIS VERSION IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR OLD DATABASE FILES***
If you get strange errors when running pam_abl about invalid arguments, you
will need to either delete or move your old database files, and let them be
recreated.

Changed the command line interface to allow non-pam interaction.  You can now
fail, whitelist (unblock), and check hosts and users from the command line.

Added the ability to run commands with parameter substitution when a host or
user is checked and they change state from the last time they were checked.

Fixed a bug that kept databases from being created if they didn't exist.

Changed the host checking to check against the host name.  This was checking
the user name against the times stored for the host in the host database.

0.3.0
Added autotools support.
Added man page documentation.
