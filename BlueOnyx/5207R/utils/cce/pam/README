this module is an authentication module that performs an authentication check against CCE.  It assumes the secret is a sessionId but has a fallback to trying to authenticate using the secret as a plain text password.  This fallback will give CCE a change to challenge pam_pwdb.

module services provided:

	auth		_authetication and _setcred (blank)
