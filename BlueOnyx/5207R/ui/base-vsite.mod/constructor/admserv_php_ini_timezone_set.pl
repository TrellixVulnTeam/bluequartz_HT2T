# This handler is run whenever a CODB Object called "PHP" is created, destroyed or 
# modified.

# If the "PHP" Object with "applicable" => "server" is created or modified, it 
# updates php.ini with those changes and Apache is restarted.

# Debugging switch:
$DEBUG = "0";

# Uncomment correct type:
$whatami = "constructor";

# Location of php.ini:
$php_ini = "/etc/admserv/php.ini";
