Short descriptions of how importing works.

The import.pl script/handler/polymorhpic thangy is run everytime it is desired
that stuff be synced up.

The mapping from ldap attirbutes to cce attributes is done as described in
spec.txt.

Searching is done for objects of class (cobalt|posix)(Account|Group). First
group objects are added/modified then users.

Before any syncing begins all objects that are to be imported have their
syncCount attribute incremented if the connection is open and the first search
for objects succeeds.

As each object is added if it is not found in the database (Search done by
looking for $obj->{name} in both cases.) it is added, if it is found it is
modified. As per the new attributes and then it's CCE
<obj>.LdapImport.syncCount attribute is set to 0.

After that is done we check to see if any objects have a syncCount of past the
maximum value (Say, 3.) and then delete them. This value shall be user
configurable from never delete to 1 (Delete if the object is not there for a
single search.)

The code is fairly simple and commented so should prove self-explanatory.
