[ DESCRIPTION ]

  This is a patch for the Cisco 5000 VPN client package.  It applies on
  the 5.2.3 linux source available from iWork.  Is the essentially the
  same as the Sun-provided one but adds a Makefile and decent initscript
  for starting the vpn tunnel and fixes a few compile problems.

  Provided in the patch are a vpn_config.in template and 'vpn' startup
  script to simplify the tunnel process.  These are also provided in this
  directory.


[ INSTALL ]

  If you already have the COMPvpn package installed you can use this
  initscript by editing the vpn_config.in file first and changing
  "________@vpn" to your Sun ID, i.e. "dl122956@vpn"

  The startup script can be placed anywhere, but preferrably somewhere
  in your PATH (default is /usr/sbin).  It is just a convienent wrapper
  around the open_tunnel command that handles the password as open_tunnel
  requires 3 passwords to be entered. (and mangles /etc/vpn_config)

  If you do not already have COMPvpn installed, download the 5.2.3
  linux source from iWork.  Then uncompress and change into the COMPvpn
  directory and apply the patch:

    patch -p1 -E < .../COMPvpn-5.2.3-duncan.patch

  This will create the 'vpn' script and 'vpn_config.in' file as well
  as a Makefile and fix a couple compile problems.  To build you will
  need the exact kernel source installed, by default this is located
  in /usr/src/linux, but can be changed by editing the Makefile.  You
  will need to configure it for your kernel and run 'make dep' in the
  kernel source dir before this can be compiled.  Then run 'make' from
  the COMPvpn directory and it will build the kernel module.

  To install, first edit the vpn_config.in file as described above,
  then run 'make install' as root.


[ USAGE ]

  Most common/simple example (uses eth0 and default server):
   /usr/sbin/vpn ffffffff

  Example using PPP and alternate server:
   /usr/sbin/vpn -i ppp0 -s central ffffffff

  Complete list of options:
   /usr/sbin/vpn -[hvnb] [-i dev] [-s host] [-u user] <password>

       -h          print this help
       -v          increase debug level
       -n          do not connect (test config file generation)
       -b          do not background tunnel process
       -i dev      network interface
       -s host     vpn gateway to connect to
       -u user     username to connect with
       password    8 character password from token card

  To get the 8-digit pseudo-hex password from the DES card just enter
  your pin then when it says EH enter 8 and it will spit one out for you.
  Then just "/usr/sbin/vpn ffffffff" and it should hopefully come online.
  The connection log is stored in /var/log/vpn.log and you can increase
  the debug output by adding a few -v arguments to the command line.
