The real-time clock seems to have failed to start.  This may be due to a
battery problem, and should be acknowledged.  Please shut down this system,
power it off for 10 seconds, then power it on.  If this error occurs again,
your battery may need to be replaced.

This error is not system-threatening, but the system time may drift while the
real-time clock is not running.
