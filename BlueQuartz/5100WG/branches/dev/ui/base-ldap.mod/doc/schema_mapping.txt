Mapping of CCE <-> Ldap Attributes.

Not everyone can be made happy - but if anyone has any tweaks tell me.

Unfortunately this bears little remembelance to any known schemas as I've
spent too much time trying to find one which will suit our needs.

I have attempted to stay as close as possible to the standard described in
rfc1274.

The schema providesa all the attributes of inetOrgPerson and posixAccount
posixGroup

The schema is yet to be formally defined for cobaltAccount/ cobaltGroup.

User..

Cce					Ldap

name				userName					
password			userPassword
fullName			commonName
siteAdministrator	siteAdmingistrator
localePreference	localepreference

Disk.User			diskUsed
Disk.Quota			diskQuota

Email.forwardEmail	forwardEmail				forwardEmail
Email.aliases		rfc822Mailbox (List of.)	emailAddr

And the DN is made up of

cn=username, group=groupname, <ldap_base>

Workgroup..

enabled				enabled
name				cn
Disk.quota			diskQuota
Disk.used			diskUsed
memberUid			list of members

e.g

User ldap object.

dn: cn=sam, group=toocanm, o=Cobalt, ou=Software Engineering
userName: Saw Berkowitz
commonName: sam
userPassword: dontknow
siteAdministrator: false
localePreference: en_AU
diskUsed: 20
diskQuota: 40
forwardEmail: forwarder@somewhere.com
emailAddr: sam@bar.com
emailAddr: sue@bar.com
