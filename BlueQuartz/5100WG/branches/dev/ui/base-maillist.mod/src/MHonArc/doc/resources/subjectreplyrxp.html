<h2>Description</h2>

<p>SUBJECTREPLYRXP defines the Perl regular expression matching
subject text that denotes a reply message.  For example, the
string "<tt>Re: </tt>" is commonly prepended to the subject
to denote a reply.
</p>

<p>SUBJECTREPLYRXP is used by MHonArc for sorting and threading
purposes.  The regex defined is used in <b><tt>s///</tt></b>
operation loops with the case-insensitive modifier.  Hence, the regex should eventually fail if
called repeatedly on the same string in an <b><tt>s///</tt></b> operation.
If not, an infinite loop will result.  In sum, SUBJECTREPLYRXP
should <strong>NOT</strong> be able to match the null string.  Also,
the regex should be anchored to the beginning of the string.
</p>

<p>The SUBJECTREPLYRXP is normally changed to suit a particular
locale or if unusual notations are being used to denote replies.
