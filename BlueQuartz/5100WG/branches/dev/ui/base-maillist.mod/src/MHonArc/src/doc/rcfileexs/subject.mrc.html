&lt;!-- This resource file utilizes the subject grouping feature of MHonArc
     to format the main index.
  --&gt;

&lt;!--	Specify subject sorting.
  --&gt;
<b><a href="../resources/subsort.html">&lt;SubSort&gt;</a></b>

&lt;!--	SUBJECTBEGIN defines the markup to be printed when a new subject
	group is started.
  --&gt;
<b><a href="../resources/subjectbegin.html">&lt;SubjectBegin&gt;</a></b>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;<b><a href="../rcvars.html#SUBJECTNA">$SUBJECTNA$</a></b>&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
<b>&lt;/SubjectBegin&gt;</b>

&lt;!--	SUBJECTEND defines the markup to be printed when a subject
	group ends.  We define it to close the &lt;UL&gt; opened by
	SUBJECTBEGIN.
  --&gt;
<b><a href="../resources/subjectend.html">&lt;SubjectEnd&gt;</a></b>
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
<b>&lt;/SubjectEnd&gt;</b>

&lt;!--	Define LITEMPLATE to display just author names.
  --&gt;
<b><a href="../resources/litemplate.html">&lt;LiTemplate&gt;</a></b>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a <b><a href="../rcvars.html#A_ATTR">$A_ATTR$</a></b>&gt;<b><a href="../rcvars.html#FROMNAME">$FROMNAME$</a></b>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
