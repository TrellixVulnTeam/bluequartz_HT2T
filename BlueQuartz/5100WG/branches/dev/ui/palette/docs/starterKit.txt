Overview
========

This is a document about things you need to know to get the user interface to
work.

UI Tree
=======

The whole user interface is stored under /usr/sausalito/ui. To install the UI
tree from CVS, check out the palette module, then do "make install".

PHP
===

PHP version 4 is required. It must be compiled with XML.

PHP needs to know the path to find PHP libraries. PHP libraries are located
under /usr/sausalito/ui/libPhp.

Edit the "include_path" setting within php.ini to the above directory.

Apache
======

Besides loading in PHP for Apache, the DocumentRoot needs to point to
/usr/sausalito/ui/web.

Configuration File
==================

/usr/sausalito/ui/conf/ui.cfg is the configuration file for the user interface.
This path is hard-coded into /usr/sausalito/ui/libPhp/System.php. Use
System.php to access the configurations. It includes paths and other settings.

The syntax of the file is, on each line:
name=value

name has a format of [a-zA-Z_\-]+
value can be of any ascii characters.

Within values, there can be other values embedded using a "[[]]" tag. For
example, with the following settings:

baseDir=/usr
subDir=[[baseDir]]/sub

subDir would be /usr/sub.

There can be comments in the file. They start with "#".

Convention
==========

Source code in palette is written to follow a convention.

Class names follow "ClassName".
Method names follow "methodName".
Variable names follow "variableName".
Static variable names follow "STATIC_VARIABLE_NAME".
Hidden names starts with a "_".
