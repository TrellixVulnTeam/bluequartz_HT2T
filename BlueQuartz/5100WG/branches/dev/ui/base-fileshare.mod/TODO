This is how it should work:
	Whenever we add a group, a handler from base-fileshare creates a
		corresponding FileShare object in CCE
	Winshare/appleshare/whatever have registered on FileShare props
	Winshare/appleshare etc. can then make the exports happen
	Other services can make a new FileShare object (with a specified path)
		samba/atalk etc all respond correctly
