### This has the same problem the modem module has.  Once you enter data, you can't erase it, since the ui complains.  And also, you can't save changes as soon as you get to this page, without entering values, even if you aren't using this function...
### PPPoE Account Password claims to be optional but it's lying.  You get an error from the Cobalt Configuration Engine if you try to save changes without data in this.
### Also, this is not consistent with the behavior of the Password fields, which should let you save changes while blank, which assumes you don't want to change passwords.
### Just try turning on this service and then turing it off again...  You will see the problems just trying to turn off the service...

###  Check to make sure this works.  Last time i checked this it appeared that the ui was pulling the error message from somewhere other than this file...
msgid "passwdField_invalid"
msgstr "Sorry, you have not entered the same password in both fields.  The same password is entered in both fields to protect against typing errors.  Please try again."

### I don't think this works right now...  I added it in anticipation of fixing the lack of error checking, though i doubt the variable is the right one.  I base this on the non-standardness of the invalid value variable...
