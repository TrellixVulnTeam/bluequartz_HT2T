dev "menlo" branch patch, it's huge

Drat, pam does more than a simple MD5 hash.  In fact, the MD5 algorithm
implemented here doesn't even seem to be compatible with Perl's
Digest::MD5 implementation.

Seems the only way to get the md5 hash correct is to use PAM's own code,
so here it is.  These source files can be used to build a "pw_to_md5"
utility, which perl can invoke.

Revision 1.1.1.1  1998/07/12 05:17:16  morgan
Linux PAM sources pre-0.66

Revision 1.2  1996/09/05 06:36:16  morgan
revised for .52 to be released


As of Linux-PAM-0.52 this is new. No known bugs yet.
