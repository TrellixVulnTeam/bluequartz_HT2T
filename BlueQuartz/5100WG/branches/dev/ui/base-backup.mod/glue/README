This is where you put all of the underlying glue code. that includes
configuration files, handlers, and initialization scripts.

Files and subdirectories should be created here to mirror where
files belong when the following installation translation occurs:
	handlers -> /usr/sausalito/handlers
	conf -> /usr/sausalito/conf
	etc -> /etc
	init.d -> /etc/rc.d/init.d
