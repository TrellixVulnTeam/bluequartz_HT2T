CODB

<new>
Properties are stored in a berkeley hash database called "objects.db" in
the CCEDBDIR (default /usr/sausalito/codb).  Each property has a key of
the form of "<OID>.<namespace>.<propertyname>" (eg. "1.Network.Enabled"
or "5..Username").  The value of this key is the value of the property.

The list of OIDs currently in use by codb is stored in the file
"codb.oids".  It is stored in intspan format - using the "-" and ","
characters to indicate continuous lists of numbers and disjoint sets of
numbers respectively.  (ie, "1-5" means 1 2 3 4 5 and "1,7" means 1 7)

The index of classname->OID mappings is stored in a berkeley hash
database called "db.classes".  The key is the classname, and the value
is the OID of that class.  Duplicate keys are of course permitted.

Any schema defined indexes are stored in CCEDBDIR/indexes.
(In version 0.80 they were stored in CCEDBDIR)
They are berkeley hash databases called "db.<classname>.<indexname>".
The key for each element is the value of the property they are indexed
on.  The data is the OID.

The version of the data stored on disk is stored in a file
"codb.version".  This version is a plaintext form of the CCE rpm
version.  If it is not found or invalid, CCE attempts to guess the
version by looking for the file "db.classes" (introduced in version
0.80.1).  If not found, it assumes a 0.76 version database, else it
assumes version 0.80.

version 0.80 differences compared to version 1.0:
Objects are stored in the "objects" directory - the directory name is
the OID, the files within are named "<namespace>.<property>" and contain
the value of the property.
version 0.76 differences compared to version 0.80:
The class index is stored in "objects/0/".  Each class is represented by
a file called "CLASS=<classname>".  The data is OIDs in 8 digit
hexadecimal format, seperated (and terminated) by "," characters.
