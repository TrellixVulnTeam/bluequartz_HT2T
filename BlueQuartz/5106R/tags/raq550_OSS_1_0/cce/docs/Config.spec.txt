1.0 File Format

	The format of a CCE hander config file is very simple: 3 fields per
	line.  The fields are:

	Class.Event		Handler Definition		Execution stage

2.0 Events

	The following are valid events (case sensitive):

	_CREATE		when an object of specified class is created
	_DESTROY		when an object of specified class is destroyed
	propertyname	when specified property of specified class is changed
	*			when any property of specified class is changed

3.0 Handler Definitions

	A handler definition consists of two parts: a handlertype and a 
	handlername.  The handlertype is one of "exec" or "test".  This is an 
	area on which future expansion is possible.  The handlername for the 
	case of "test" is a string to output.  The handlername for the case of 
	"exec" is the path to an executable to run.  A handler is run when the 
	corresponding class.event field is triggered.

4.0 Stages

	Stages allow handler writers to suggest a relative order for their 
	handler to execute in.  There are 5 defined stages (case insensitive):

	validate
	configure
	execute
	test
	cleanup

	If the stage field is left off, the handler will be in the "execute"
	stage.  Relative ordering between stages is guaranteed, but ordering 
	within a given stage is not.

5.0 File Naming

	CCE will find all files which end with ".conf" in /usr/sausalito/conf 
	and any subdirectories thereof.  The only exception to this is that
	any file or directory that begins with "." will be ignored.

6.0 Sample conf file

	Test._CREATE	exec:/usr/sausalito/bin/test_create 	configure
	Test._DESTROY	exec:/usr/sausalito/bin/test_destroy 	test
	Test.*		exec:/usr/sausalito/bin/test_mod
