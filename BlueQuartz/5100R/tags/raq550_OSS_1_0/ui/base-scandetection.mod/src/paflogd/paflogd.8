.SH NAME
paflogd \- log firewall messages to disk files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B paflogd
[<options> ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B paflogd
logs messages generated by the kernel firewall component to disk
files. It can accept messages at a much higher rate than the system 
.I syslogd
can. Buffer overruns are not silently ignored, but the number of lost
messages is also logged. 
.B paflogd 
automatically rotates log files when they reach a certain size, and
discards log files when the maximum file count is reached.
