1.0 Overview

This document describes how the requirements for integrating the Knox Arkeia
client are implemented.

2.0 Arkeia

The attributes of the Arkeia set are converted into CCE properties as follows:

	Attribute	Property
	---------------	----------------
	Enabled		enabled
	Server		server
	Port		port

Events are implemented as CCE events.  They are:

        Event           CCE Event       Handler
        --------------  --------------  ---------------------
        Create          CREATE          create
        Modify          *               modify, am_arkeia.pl
        Delete          DESTROY         delete

am_arkeia.pl is used to syncronize the enabled property with the associated
Arkeia Active Monitor object (see below).

2.1 Create Event

When an Arkeia object is created, the create handler ensures that there is not
existing object in the system already and that the parameters given are valid.
If an object exists or the parameters are not valid, the handler sets CCE baddata
and exits with failure.

When the parameters are correct, the necessary Arkeia client configuation files
are updated.  They are:

	Property	File
	---------------	-------------------------------
	enabled		/usr/knox/bin/NLSERVD start
			/etc/rc.d/init.d/cobalt-arkeia

			Values: if enabled is 0, then state is 'stop', otherwise
			the state is 'start'.  cobalt-arkeia is used to integrate
			with chkconfig and the state set accordingly.

			Note: Arkeia ships a init script that is not chkconfig
			compliant.  This script is removed during the post-install
			state of this package.

	server		/usr/knox/nlp/admin.cfg

			The first line of the file must contain the server
			name.  No comments are allowed in the file (not even
			shell-style '#' comments).

	port		/usr/knox/nlp/nlp.cfg

			The file must be scanned for the line beginning with
			'PORT_NUMBER'.  The form of the line must be:
			'^PORT_NUMBER %d' where ^ indicates the beginning of
			the line and %d is replaced with the port number.

2.2  Modify Event

When the Arkeia object is modified, the parameters are checked for validity. If
they are valid, the client daemon is stopped, the configuration files indicated
above are updated, and the client daemon restarted (if enabled is true).

2.3  Delete Event

When the Arkeia object is deleted, no special action is taken.
