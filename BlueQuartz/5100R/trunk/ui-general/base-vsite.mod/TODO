Site Management

Edit template
- The "Edit Template" button should be on top of the
scroll list because
it does not affect items in the list. (Medium)
- "Disk Quota" should be "Maximum Allowed Disk Space
(MB)". (Low)
- "User Limit" should be "Maximum Allowed Number of
Users". (Low)
- "Email Catchall" does not suggest what type of info to
fill in.
Replace it with "Catch-All Email Address". (Low)

Add site
- Disk space and maximum connections for anonymous FTP
are meaningless
unless anonymous FTP is enabled, so the whole anonymous
FTP should be a
single "Anonymous FTP" MultiChoice with an "Enable"
option that has
"Maximum Allowed Upload Disk Space (MB)" and "Maximum
Simultaneous
Connections" integer fields. (High)
- Webmaster password is meaningless if FrontPage web is
not enabled. Fix
it like anonymous FTP. See frontpage on Qube 3 for
details. (High)
- Don't use so many tabs here. When adding a
virtual site, in most
cases, all features of the site needs to be double
checked. To do this
across pages, users need to click on tabs a lot of
times. Worse, they
frequently forget what was on the last page. Therefore,
use dividers
instead. The page becomes (in this order): (High)

IP Address
Host Name / Domain Name 
Web Server Aliases
Email Server Aliases
Catch-All Email Address
Site Directory Location
Maximum Allowed Disk Space (MB)
Maximum Allowed Number of Users

- STATISTICS GETS REMOVED FROM ADD SITE, GREY HEADER ROLL STARTS
FEATURES SECTION AND CALLS AUTOFEATURES STUFF WHICH GET INCLUDED IN
SHORT FORMAT (NO TABS). WOULD REALLY LIKE TO ENHANCE AUTOFEATURES SO
THAT YOU CAN SPECIFY ORDER - E.G. START FILENAMES WITH NUMBERS (LIKE
INIT SCRIPTS) SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A SHOT AT SPECIFYING ORDER THEY WILL
APPEAR IN. THIS DESIGN SHOULD MAKE THE ADD SITE 1 PAGE WITHOUT TABS -
AUTOFEATURES ADDITIONS BY 3RD PARTIES CAN STILL ADD TABS, BUT BY DEFAULT
WE'LL HAVE A CLEAN 1 PAGER (THAT'S THE DREAM, AT LEAST). 

- Site directory location field doesn't appear if there isn't a choice.

- Print boundary limit for "Maximum Allowed Upload Disk
Space (MB)" and
"Maximum Simultaneous Connections" fields. (Medium)
- What is default directory? Instead of forcing users to
read help text,
show the meaning of things. Use "Default Directory
(/home)" instead of
"Default Directory". ONLY WHEN FIELD SHOWS UP.(Medium)

- There are uses of bold text to highlight examples in
help text. Make
sure all help text throughout the whole product use bold
text for the
same purpose. (Low)
- Title should consistently be "Add New Virtual Site".
(Low)

Site list page
- There should be no "suspend/unsuspend" button on the
list. First,
state change buttons can be confusing. Users clicking on
the same place
expects the same outcome. Second, the list is for
browsing, but not
modifying. Move the functionality into the site
management site. SUSPEND CHECKBOX IN SITE SETTINGS AS IN XTR. (High)


Site list page
Advanced Search
- Not sure if fields in search criteria can change order
according to
locale properties, but they better do. Grammers of
different languages
are different. (High)
- In places where order matter, important things always
go first. Search
criteria should be ordered as "Contains", "is", "Begins
With", "Ends
With", "Does Not Contain". Beware of capitalization.
(Medium)
- CAN WE STORE THE SITES PER PAGE IN THE DEFAULTS IN CCE LIKE WE WERE
DOING BEFORE WHEN IT WAS IN THE VSITE DEFAULTS? 
- FYI - ERIC B. IS GOING TO MAKE THE SITE LIST BASIC SEARCH SIMPLER SO
THAT IT IS SMALLER SINCE WE HAVE ADVANCED SEARCH
